Lonestream Netflix-style Hero Clone (React)

How to use:
1. Unzip the project.
2. Put your exact screenshot image (the one you supplied) into `public/hero.jpg` (replace the existing placeholder).
3. Run `npm install` then `npm start` to launch locally.

Notes:
- This is a small create-react-app style skeleton (no CRA bootstrapping files included). It relies on react-scripts from npm.
- The hero layout, typography, button styles and overlays are built to match the screenshot as closely as possible.
